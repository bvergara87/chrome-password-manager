#Chrome Extension: Toy Password Manage#

This is a working proof-of-concept password manager for Chrome that works as an extension. (Will act as base for the password manager in Javelin Browser)

##POC##

This really shouldn't be used in production, rather, you can explore the code to understand how a password manager saves and restores login fields.
